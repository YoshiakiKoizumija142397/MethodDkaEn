1st-order equations are taught in the first year of junior high school, and 2nd-order equations are taught in the third year of junior high school. For 3rd-order equations and higher, you can use Cardano's formula or numerical analysis methods such as Lagrange's method or Newton's method. However, for 4th-order equations and higher, you must rely on numerical analysis unless the equation is special.

Most programs require initial values or can only find real solutions. However, this program can find all solutions, including complex numbers, for higher-order equations (up to 1000th order) without initial values.

First, enter the highest degree in the text box. Input boxes will open, so please enter the real coefficients in order from the highest degree. The coefficients of the entered degrees will be displayed. If there is no coefficient for a degree, enter 0 (zero). You cannot omit any coefficients!

As a general rule, if the coefficient is plus 1, enter 1, and if it is minus 1, enter -1.

The significant figures of the solutions are about 14 digits. Even if more digits are displayed, they are not meaningful, so please be aware of this. Using this program as the initial value for a program that seeks higher precision solutions will yield good results! 

We are not responsible for any problems that arise from using this program. Please use it at your own risk (verify the calculations yourself before using).

Thank you for reading the help file to the end! We hope this program will be useful to you.

Finally, I would like to thank my teachers who taught me arithmetic and mathematics, and the authors of books on numerical analysis!

This software is a free software as it is a prototype evaluation version.

This program was converted from my Android Java source code to JavaScript by Microsoft's Windows Copilot in Microsoft Edge. Thank you, Microsoft!
